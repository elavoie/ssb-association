# SSB Association

Constitution and procedures for a Secure-Scuttlebutt native association. The constitution is written for democratically allocating funds through the ssbc-grants process as this was the first use case for it. Feel free to fork and adapt to your own circumstances.

It is made of the following files:
* [Constitution](./constitution): Rules for managing the association, including membership, roles, voting process, and handling finances, organized in separate modules.
* [Message Templates](./messages.md): Message templates to use when communicating over SSB through regular messages.
* [TODO](./TODO.md): Issues to fix later in the constitution.
