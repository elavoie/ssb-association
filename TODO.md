# TODO

## v0.2 (Core Membership)
### General
- [x] Rework general presentation
- [x] Add a license

### Crypto-donations
- [x] Handle donations through Open Collective
- [ ] Clarify how to mint a new assotoken
- [ ] Clarify how to transfer funds between active members

### Messaging Protocol
- [ ] Mandate the use of the #iasu channel

### Membership Protocol
- [ ] Add the requirement that the president needs to follow-back an active member and the members need to follow the president
- [ ] Handle a possible sybil attack in which someone may create multiple accounts to obtain more than one vote during decisions processes (we would have one vote per "share" of membership rather than one vote per person). Possible solution:
    - Add two additional requirements for becoming a member:
      - being followed by at least one other active members;
      - having a minimum number of messages in the feed.
      for two reasons:  
      - it reduces the possibility of a Sybil attack, in which a single user creates
      multiple SSB IDs and pays the membership multiple times to have multiple votes,
      because

2. Treasurer sends a unique address for that member

- [ ] Clarify that the values of Bitcoin funds may be reach the threshold because Bitcoin's value has appreciated
